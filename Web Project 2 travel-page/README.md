This is my second web project made in the course 100 Days of Code - 2023 Web Development Bootcamp. It is a travel page featuring 3 pages.
The first page introduces users to the travel website with a hero image and a link to the destinations in the next page.
The second page contains the destinations I would like to visit as well as short descriptions of these destinations, why I would like to visit these places and a link to the Wikipedia page for more information.
The last page contains the link to my Github profile and thanks the person for visiting my webpage.
All 3 pages can be accessed with the header and instagram and facebook can also be accessed through clickable icons at the footer.
